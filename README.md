# S23-112-Motion-Seat-Ride
The primary objective of this project is to control pneumatic actuators in a Stewart platform configuration. The system will take a vector [pitch, roll, yaw] and convert it to actuator lengths [l1, ..., l6] using the Matrix functions and datatypes provided in arm_math.h.  The desired lengths are then achieved using a basic Proportional-Integral control loop using linear **position** as the input signal.  The valves of the pneumatic system are solenoid-controlled, necessitating a pretty low frequency (~1.4 Hz) PWM signal for each valve.
## Directory Structure
The directories were separated thusly, in an effort to decouple the procedures outlined above from the STM32 architecture as much as possible.

### Application

The application files complete the functionality of the Simulink block diagram provided in the MATLAB directory. As previously described, polar rotations are converted into actuator lengths, which are controlled with a PI controller.

### Intermediate

Files here serve the purpose of separating Application implementations from HALs.  This is not completely achieved, especially in the case of the matrix math.  The inheretor of the code is encouraged to remedy this problem.

### Core

Most prominently contains the main header and source files, as well as the bootloader and HAL files generated by CubeMX.

### Drivers

STM32 HALs and Arm libraries.
